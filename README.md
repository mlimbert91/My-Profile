<h1>My IT Profile</h1>

<p>Email: s3818719@student.rmit.edu.au
<p><b>My name is Matthew Limbert,</b> and I have loved using computers all my life. It would be no exaggeration to say that IT is something I am genuinely passionate about. My parents bought our first family computer when I was 5 years old and I was enraptured by the point and click adventure games and side scrollers that were available at the time, around 1996. Ever since then I have been fascinated with their function. I am quite skilled dealing with computer hardware but am looking to improve my software and programming abilities, as-well as seeking a recognizable qualification. As such I have enrolled in the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology's online Bachelor of Information Technology course. During my time studying with RMIT I hope to increase my knowledge of computer systems and attain a qualification that I can use to apply for the types of jobs that I'd like to do.</p>

The role of a Project Manager entails managing and delivering outcomes for projects as required by the organization within specified time, budget, risks and issues. The role also entails coordinating and managing workload among project team members to ensure agreed outcomes are achieved, monitoring and tracking the progress of the project using Project Management principles and Building and maintaining relationship with stakeholders through effective communication.

To be able to get into Project Manager role one must have a Project Management qualification, should have experience in managing project and implementation, coordinating resource and budget management, and identifying and managing risk. Should also have extensive knowledge on project management applications and tools.

For me to able to get into this role I will start by getting the required qualification for Project Management,  I will have to be involve in work projects until I get enough experience to be able to manage and coordinate a project on my own, Build my knowledge around tools and techniques relevant to project management. 
 So the programming aspect of my current curriculum will help immensely with my understanding of these concepts. Upon completion of my Bachelors in Information Technology I intend to enroll in a project management course.</p>
<h2>Personality Test Results</h2>
<b>I am a Logistician ISTJ</b> 
https://www.opencolleges.edu.au/careers/career-quiz/result/the-logistician-m</p>
<p>ISTJ STRENGTHS
Honest: ISTJs prize personal integrity and being truthful.

Responsible: You can trust an ISTJ to do exactly what they have promised to do, even if it is at a personal cost to themselves.

Practical: ISTJs make clear decisions based on facts and reason. They prefer work that has practical rather than theoretical outcomes.

Create order: ISTJs make sure to communicate goals, rules and guidelines clearly so that everyone involved knows how to achieve their common goals. They have low tolerance for missed deadlines or setbacks that could have been prevented.

Jack-of-all-trades: ISTJs are able to retain a lot of knowledge around facts and statistics, and can apply this information in a variety of situations.

ISTJ WEAKNESSES
Judgemental: ISTJs tend not to respect those who disagree or choose to ignore the facts.

Insensitive: Because honesty is so important to an ISTJ, they are unlikely to take others’ feelings into account when the truth needs to be told.

Stubborn: There’s no arguing with the facts, and ISTJs will resist new ideas that aren’t factually supported.

Stick to the rules: ISTJs love a clear structure and are most uncomfortable in situations that are less clearly defined, or where rules can be bent.

Take the blame: ISTJs hold themselves to such high standards that if an outcome is less than perfect, they will hold themselves accountable and berate themselves for things they should have done differently.

WHAT ISTJS LOOK FOR IN A CAREER
Stability: ISTJs dislike change and prefer roles that have proven longevity, often in more traditional organisations or institutions.

Clear hierarchy: ISTJs need to know who is responsible for what and who is in charge. A clear organisational hierarchy is important to them.

Structure: ISTJs value work that responds to logic and facts and has clearly defined rules.

Responsibility: ISTJs love being given responsibility; it’s proof that they are trusted and are the best person for the job.</p>

<p><b>The results of this test indicates that I have a logic driven mindset and work best with form goals in mind and a clear organisational heirarchy. I have a tendancy to take on alot of responsibility and take on alot of pressure and blame myself when things go wrong, and the truth is more important to me than the feelings of other people.</p>
  
<p><b>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?:</b> In a team situation I have a tendancy to want to follow a clearly defined leader, however if no clear direction is taking place and things seem disorganised I will feel the need to step up and make things happen as a lack of organisation makes me anxious regarding the results.</p>
<p><b>How should you take this into account when forming a team?:</b> I need a team that is willing to understand that if I say something that seem blunt I am simply trying to get to the point of the matter and do not mean to be abrasive. I am driven by getting to the clear truth of the matter and value the integrity of my own work and expect the same from others.</p>

<h1>My IT Profile</h1>
<p><b>My name is Matthew Limbert,</b> and I have loved using computers all my life. It would be no exaggeration to say that IT is something I am genuinely passionate about. My parents bought our first family computer when I was 5 years old and I was enraptured by the point and click adventure games and side scrollers that were available at the time, around 1996. Ever since then I have been fascinated with their function. I am quite skilled dealing with computer hardware but am looking to improve my software and programming abilities, as-well as seeking a recognizable qualification. As such I have enrolled in the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology's online Bachelor of Information Technology course. During my time studying with RMIT I hope to increase my knowledge of computer systems and attain a qualification that I can use to apply for the types of jobs that I'd like to do.</p>

A project manager is a highly respected and important field in business. I personally know 2 people who already perform this role at a corporate level and a third who is currently training to. This job is usually high pressure but both personally and financially rewarding, with salaries often upwards of $150K. A project is an undertaking with a defined beginning and a required outcome. A project will often involve coordination between groups with vastly differing skills and backgrounds and requires someone to pool these recourses and effectively delegate operations to the most relevant teams.</p>
<p>An IT Project manager would need some form of qualification in both information technology and project management. The skills required to perform the role of project manager are quite broad and include the coordination of multiple teams of people, the effective communication of defined goals and the role each unit plays in acheiving it, a broad knowledge of the concepts involved in the project field and the leadership skills to keep everyone on task.</p>
<p>My own skills include: Moderate to Advanced knowledge of Microsoft Office and a basic understanding of most IT concepts. It is something that has been</p>
<p>Currently, my own leadership skills would need to be improved dramatically, and my highest form of IT qualififcation is a certificate 2 from Vocational Training undertaken in high school. My life experiences have left me a somewhat anti social individual but I want to work on that as I feel I have the ability to hold a position like this but need the education to make it happen. Programming is something I have not dabbled in since creating an awfully edgy myspace page that I dare not link to in 2007. I had a somewhat working knowledge of CSS and a very basic understanding of HTML. So the programming aspect of my current curriculum will help immensely with my understanding of these concepts. Upon completion of my Bachelors in Information Technology I intend to enroll in a project management course.</p>
